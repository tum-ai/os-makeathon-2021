# Makeathon 2021 Notebooks

Hi Makers!

We've got some Jupyter-Notebooks for you in this repo!ðŸ˜Š They should serve as an inspiration / starting point for your own apps. For that purpose, the notebooks cover quite some gound: Theory, ML-tools & -technologies, notebook-UIs etc.. 

2 Things to keep in mind: 
* Using this material is optional. Feel free to go freestyle on your apps right from the start!
* Some notebook outputs don't render as they should when inspected on GitHub. Downloading the notebook-files and inspecting them locally should give you the output in beautifully rendered form!ðŸ˜Š

Content:
* Intro (Notebook 1): Some Theory on transfer learning || General info on notebooks
* NLP (Notebook 2): Information extraction || Text classification || Text generation || Notebook-UIs
* Computer Vision (Notebook 3): Image classification || Semantic segmentation || Object detection 
* Regression (Notebook 4): Decision trees & Random forests
